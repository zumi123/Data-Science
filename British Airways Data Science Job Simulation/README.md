# British Airways Data Science Job Simulation

I recently participated in British Airways job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate on a Data Science team at British Airways.

I worked on a project where I analyzed customer insights and built predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behavior. I practiced my data analytics skills using a Jupyter Notebook and built my PowerPoint and communication skills by presenting insights a real-world context.
